Going back to our old school days,

some of the pen-paper games were always a top for our leisure time.

Hangman was one, other than some chit games, to guess words according to the guesses determined and as soon as they lost all their wrong guesses, they were hanged (not really, but on paper 😉).

That is an old way, now to play Hangman. 

The new advancement in technologies allows us to play hangman using our own computer also without any other player.

The objective of my project is to implement the hangman game using Python.


The data structures that take the code to the next step : lists, tuples, dict.

Word Management : Using files allows me to take words in an orderly manner without touching the code itself
